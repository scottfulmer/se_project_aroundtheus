Intro

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them here, so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!

My name is Scott Fulmer and am a student at practicum. this project is named Around the U.S. this project entails different media queries on popular screen sizes that is used on our way day-to-day lives. We were tasked on using grids instead of flexboxes and also using percentages and fractions and not fixed pixels like the other 2 projects that weve done.
