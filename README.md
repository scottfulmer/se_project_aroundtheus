This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them here, so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!

My name is Scott Fulmer and this project displays a working website with interactive design.
you can view the website in any screen size and there wont be any horizontal scrolling and all of its contents will fit according to the screen size.
you can also Add and remove pictures as you wish, like pictures, and even change the name of the person and the occupation.
